## 2026-09-16 — I-01 environment setup and first runtime verification

Interpreter: `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/python3.11` (Python 3.11.5, CPython, macOS-26.6.2-arm64-arm-64bit). Chosen per `docs/PLAN.md` D07. Project-dedicated venv created at `.venv/` (previously the shell's active `python3` resolved to an unrelated project's Python 3.9.6 virtualenv, which does not satisfy `pyproject.toml`'s `>=3.10`).

### Command

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Result

Passed. Core deps (`gymnasium==1.3.0`, `mujoco==3.13.0`, `numpy==2.4.6`, `PyYAML==6.0.3`, `matplotlib==3.11.2`) and dev deps (`pytest==9.1.1`, `ruff==0.16.7`) installed without conflicts. Full pinned set recorded in `requirements-lock.txt`. `rl`/`snn` optional extras (stable-baselines3, torch, brian2) were not installed in this pass — out of scope for I-01's core verification.

### Command

```bash
python -c "import envs, controllers, encoders, train, analysis, demos"
# plus explicit per-submodule imports, including controllers.brian2_stdp_controller
```

### Result

Passed. All 6 top-level packages and every submodule import without error, including `controllers.brian2_stdp_controller` despite brian2 not being installed (confirms it is interface-only, per existing docs — no top-level `import brian2` yet).

### Command

```python
import mujoco
model = mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_path("envs/assets/fly_batter.xml")
data = mujoco.MjData(model)
mujoco.mj_step(model, data)
```

### Result

Passed — first actual MuJoCo runtime load and physics step in this project (previously only XML-syntax-checked, never loaded by the MuJoCo runtime). `nq=8 nv=7 nu=1 nbody=4`, one step advances `data.time` to `0.002` (confirms `model.opt.timestep=0.002`, so `max_steps = int(1.6/(0.002*5)) = 160` in `FlyBatterEnv`).

### Command

```python
from envs.fly_batter_env import FlyBatterEnv
env = FlyBatterEnv()
obs, info = env.reset(seed=0)
# 20 random-action steps
```

### Result

Passed — first successful Gymnasium `reset`/`step` cycle. `obs.shape=(11,)`, `action_space=Box(-1,1,(1,))`. No exceptions, no NaN.

### Command

```bash
python -m demos.record_episode  # internally: FlyBatterEnv + ScriptedSwingController, 5 episodes, seeds 0-4
python demos/record_episode.py --episodes 3 --render none
```

### Result

Ran to completion without crashing (measured, not a target number): scripted controller scored **0/5 hits** across 5 episodes (160 steps each, terminates only on contact or `max_steps`/ball-passed truncation). `demos/record_episode.py --episodes 3` produced episode rewards on the order of **-2×10⁷**, far larger in magnitude than the -20..-25 range seen in the direct 20-step random-action check above. Root cause not investigated further here (out of scope for I-01) — the `timing_error` reward term divides by ball x-velocity (`envs/fly_batter_env.py:_time_to_swing_zone`) and is only guarded for `abs(vx) < 1e-6`; under the known uncompensated-gravity trajectory (`docs/records/PROJECT_AUDIT_2026-09-16.md` P0) the ball likely crosses low-`vx` states after ground contact, which is consistent with this magnitude. This is corroborating measured evidence for I-03, not a newly diagnosed bug; no fix applied.

### Command

```bash
pip install build && python -m build --wheel
```

### Result

Passed. All 6 declared packages (`envs`, `controllers`, `encoders`, `train`, `analysis`, `demos`) and `envs/assets/fly_batter.xml` are present in the built wheel — package-data inclusion for the new asset is intact.

### Command

```bash
pytest --collect-only -q
ruff check .
```

### Result

`pytest`: runs, 0 tests collected (`tests/` does not exist yet — expected, no test suite has been written). `ruff`: runs, found 5 pre-existing lint issues in `envs/fly_batter_env.py` (import order, mutable class-attribute default) — not fixed here, out of I-01 scope.

### Notes

This establishes a working, reproducible environment and first-ever runtime execution of the existing scaffold. It does **not** establish physics correctness, learning performance, or that `FlyBatterEnv`'s reward/termination logic is sound — see I-03 in `docs/implementation/WORK_PACKAGES.md` for the known physics defects this run's numbers are consistent with.

## 2026-09-16 — Planning structure review

- Compared SHA-256 fingerprints before/after the documentation changes for all 22 existing Python, XML, TOML and YAML files: identical; no implementation or runtime configuration changes.
- Checked relative Markdown links across 15 root/config/project documents: no missing targets.
- Reviewed active-plan, historical-roadmap, and pending-choice labels for consistency with the Claude implementation handoff.
- These were documentation consistency checks only. No application tests, package installation, physics simulation, or learning experiment was run.

## 2026-09-15–16 — Planning review

- Read 19 Python files, XML, config, package metadata, and project documents.
- Parsed all Python sources with `ast.parse`, without importing dependencies or generating bytecode: 19 passed.
- Current shell inspection: arm64, macOS 26.6.2, Python 3.14.0. NumPy, MuJoCo, Gymnasium, PyTorch, Brian2, SB3 and pytest were absent from this interpreter.
- Memory query `sysctl -n hw.memsize` was denied; available RAM remains unknown.
- Analytic launch check: missing gravity correction causes 2.5428–4.4268 m displacement relative to target over 0.72–0.95 s, assuming free flight. Ground collision was not simulated.
- No local `.git` entry in the project folder. No Git initialization was performed.
- Initial documentation patch was rejected during patch validation; no files changed in that attempt. A revised documentation-only patch was then applied.
- No dependency installation, runtime physics test, external model execution, training, or dataset download was performed.

These checks establish source findings, not physics correctness or model performance.

## 2026-09-15

### Command

```bash
python3 -m compileall envs controllers encoders train analysis demos
```

### Result

Passed. All Python source files compiled successfully.

### Notes

The local shell did not provide `python`; `python3` was used instead.

## 2026-09-15

### Command

```bash
python3 -c "import tomllib; tomllib.load(open('pyproject.toml','rb')); print('pyproject ok')"
```

### Result

Passed. `pyproject.toml` parsed successfully.

## 2026-09-15

### Command

```bash
python3 -c "import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET; ET.parse('envs/assets/fly_batter.xml'); print('xml ok')"
```

### Result

Passed. The MuJoCo XML file is well-formed XML.

### Limitations

This only checks XML syntax. It does not validate MuJoCo semantics or runtime physics behavior.

## 2026-09-15

### Command

```bash
python3 -c "import sys; print(sys.version); import importlib.util; print('mujoco', importlib.util.find_spec('mujoco')); print('gymnasium', importlib.util.find_spec('gymnasium'))"
```

### Result

`mujoco` and `gymnasium` were not installed in the current environment.

### Next Runtime Test

After installing dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python demos/record_episode.py --episodes 3 --render none
```
